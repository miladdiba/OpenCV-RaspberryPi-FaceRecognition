Just follow the steps 1-3.

1.Run "AdvancedDataSetCreator.py".
After a few seconds it will ask you to "enter person's id" 
you can enter any number you prefer. However, you must notice that each specified number id is dedicated to a specific person. thereby, remember each person's id.
Detector's code is written in such a way that it detects frontal face and profile face (both right and left sides). Hence, you don't have to stare at the picamera all the time. you can make head-turns and look around.
while detecting faces, you must observe the following messages on the screen.For instance,
Found 1 frontal_face
Found 1 profile-face
Found 1 profile-face-flipped
In above mentioned messages number '1' is in the case that only one person stands in front of the camera.
In some cases you may observe that althogh the person is looking to his/her rightside, you get messages (frontal_face and profile_face) together. this is actually good and it depends mostly on the samples included in Haarcascade xml files.

Once sampling is done, press 'q' to exit.
you must also be able to see captured photos of faces in the folder named 'datasets'.

2.Run "AdvancedTrainer.py".
This will create a '.yml' file for you in the folder named 'recognizer'.

3.Run "Advanced Detector.py" and Enjoy.

Feel free to ask if you had further questions about the codes or you encounter with errors while running.
